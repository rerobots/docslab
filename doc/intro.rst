Introduction
============

The aim of this project is to support learning and development by making
documentation about robots and electronics interactive.
Run examples on real hardware in a safe and reproducible way.

Getting started
---------------

**docslab** is essentially a TypeScript package that makes HTML ``code`` blocks
interactive. The kind of interactivity provided depends on the target hardware,
but in all cases, hardware is provisioned with hardshare_.


Complete examples written in HTML are shown at `<examples/html>`_
